## Problem

Getting a workable class schedule means checking course requirements against meeting patterns, a work shift, and everything else already on the calendar, across a lot of possible combinations.

## Solution

The TritonGPT Class Scheduling Assistant asks which courses you need and when you are unavailable, checks for conflicts, and proposes a combination to review. Add a work shift or anything else and ask it to try again.

This assistant is distinct from the standalone Class Planner web app. Planning happens in TritonGPT; official course review and booking remain in the student system.

## Current status

In production in TritonGPT. It produces a proposed schedule for students to review. Students still have to verify the course requirements, meeting details, and availability, and do the actual booking themselves.
