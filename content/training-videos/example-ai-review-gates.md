## Transcript

This example entry reuses the Harness demonstration footage while the first training recordings are in production. The recording follows a single website change through every gate: automated checks run while the work is local, a person reviews the complete diff and rendered preview, a pull request records the decision, and an authorized person merges. Publishing runs as a separate workflow, and the final step is comparing the public page against the approved preview before reporting the change as live.
