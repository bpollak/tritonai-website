<p class="hub-lede">TritonAI gives campus services approved routes to AI models and campus information. Anyone can review the privacy, security, and accessibility decisions behind those routes on this site.</p>
<p>The platform does not make a service trustworthy on its own. Each service still needs a stated purpose, data it is allowed to use, a named owner, and people who check the results.</p>

<div class="hub-heading"><p class="home-kicker">UC data classification</p><h2 id="protection-levels-heading">What the Protection Levels mean</h2><p>UC assigns Institutional Information and IT Resources one of four Protection Levels based on the potential impact of unauthorized disclosure or modification.
