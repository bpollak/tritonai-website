<p class="hub-lede">TritonAI Harness uses a local-first architecture. Your project files, transcripts, and credentials stay on your computer. This statement explains what data stays local, what passes through the gateway, and how UC policies apply.</p>
<p>Unlike centralized web chat interfaces, the Harness does not retain your work on campus servers. You keep custody of your local files and project history.</p>

<h3>Active prompt context &amp; zero silent fallback</h3>
<p>When an agent turn executes, only the prompt text and specific file snippets needed for that turn travel across encrypted HTTPS to the TritonAI Gateway.</p>
<p>Campus on-premises models hosted on campus infrastructure process requests with <strong>zero data retention</strong> and <strong>no model training</strong>. Your prompts are discarded after generating the response.</p>
<p>The Harness maintains an <strong>empty cloud fallback list</strong> by default. If an on-premises model is temporarily unavailable, the error is surfaced immediately. Private campus context is never silently redirected to external cloud providers.</p>

<h3>Usage and billing telemetry</h3>
<p>The Gateway logs request timestamps, model identifiers, token counts, and account identifiers to monitor platform availability, manage quotas, and apply recharge billing where applicable.</p>
<p>The Gateway does not record the text content of your local files, shell command outputs, or conversation transcripts in its telemetry logs.</p>
