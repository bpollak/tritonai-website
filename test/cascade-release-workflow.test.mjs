// all. That was aimed at the wrong pipeline. The accidental publishes came from
// GitHub Pages, which deployed from main on every push and again hourly;
// locking down Cascade stopped the release path while leaving the cause in
// place. Pages now publishes from the playground branch, and Cascade is
// branch-driven again.
